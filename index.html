             <p style="color:#e8defa">A birthday is the anniversary of the birth of a person, or figuratively of an institution. Birthdays of people are celebrated in numerous cultures, with birthday gifts, birthday cards, a birthday party.</p>

             <p style="color:#e8defa">A birthday is one of favorite days of the year. It may be hard to believe, but it isn't just about the attention either. I will be forever grateful for my birthdays, even when getting old.</p>

            <p style="color:#e8defa">They come once a year – just one day but they can hold so much in them – memories, sadness, happiness, surprises and shocks sometimes! It’s my birthday today and as ever it’s got me thinking about life – the ups and downs, the uncertainties and emotions we experience as humans.</p>

            <p style="color:#e8defa">So when it’s your birthday next remember you are not too old to do new things and to make a difference in your world. Remember those you have lost with love and gratitude, as much as you can and let the emotions come.</p>

            <p style="color:#e8defa">Birthdays are much more than cake and presents. While these things can be part of the fun, they don’t fully capture the significance of a birthday.Birthdays also offer the chance to reflect on what has been achieved over the past year; whether it’s discovering new hobbies or launching a career-defining project.</p>
